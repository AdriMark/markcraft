# AdriMark

Hi! I’m one of the co-owners of MarkCraft along with SMT Mark. I make Minecraft videos, stream the server on Twitch, and handle a lot of the community and technical work. You can also find some custom addons I’ve made over on the Addons page.

  <div class="build-item"><img src="/assets/images/builds/docks.webp" alt="A warmly lighted dock area built on a deepslate base, with spruce buildings, and blue warped wood for the roof. The center building is a tavern with a large mug sign on the front." /></div>
  <div class="build-item"><img src="/assets/images/builds/diamond_dice.webp" alt="A two story building with grey walls on the first floor and blue walls on the second, with brown mud bricks for the accents. At the top of the building is a sign that shows a large dice built out of diamond blocks." /></div>
  <div class="build-item"><img src="/assets/images/builds/chess.webp" alt="A very large chessboard with blackstone pieces on the left and white quartz pieces on the right. None of the pieces have moved from their starting points." /></div>
  <div class="build-item"><img src="/assets/images/builds/clocktower.webp" alt="A tall orange copper clocktower sits in the middle of an unfinished city. Along the building's sides are yellow lights and an orange beacon comes out from the top of the structure." /></div>
  <div class="build-item"><img src="/assets/images/builds/end_bridge.webp" alt="Many endermen stand ontop of a white bridge that floats above the purple glowing void. On the bridge are arches that glow white and repeat every few blocks. In the distance, the outline of an end island can be seen, but the details cannot be made out." /></div>
